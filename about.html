<p>Hi everyone, first of all, a warm welcome to my page. My name is Jashandeep Singh Sethi and i am a new web developer 
  who has just learning to develop web pages through html.
</p>

<p>I am learning from a course on udemy.com and i really find this course very helpful and will definetely recomend you 
  guys to give it a try if you are aspiring to learn about web development and become a web developer.</p>

<p>It has just been 10 days into web developing and I am really enjoying it a lot. I am really looking forward to make 
  new projects and connect with clients once I have mastered web developing.
